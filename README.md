## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between the dining landscape (specifically the prevalence of different cuisines) and public health outcomes (obesity rates) across European countries. By merging large-scale restaurant data from TripAdvisor with health and economic statistics, we aim to identify potentially "obesogenic" or "protective" dietary environments.

### 🎯 Research Question
*Does the prevalence of fast food restaurants significantly impact a country's obesity rate, and does this relationship hold when controlling for economic factors like GDP?*

## 📂 Data Access
**⚠️ Important:** Due to GitHub's file size limits, the large raw datasets (>100MB) are hosted externally. To run the analysis notebooks, you must download these files and place them in the root directory of the project.

| File Name | Description | Download Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`tripadvisor_european_restaurants2 (1).csv`** | Raw TripAdvisor restaurant data (~1040k rows) | [**DOWNLOAD HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dp63rvyay0YMqavi30rBcIM31BfltwAA/view?usp=drive_link) |

## 🚀 Repository Structure

The analysis is divided into 5 sequential Jupyter Notebooks:

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
* **`cleaning.ipynb`**: Handles initial loading and cleaning of the raw TripAdvisor dataset. It checks for missing values, standardizes columns, and prepares the data for analysis.
* **`Obesity.ipynb`**: Processes the global health dataset (`filtered_data.csv`) to filter for European countries and extract the most recent obesity rates and GDP figures.

### 2. Feature Engineering & Merging
* **`european_restaurants (1).ipynb`**: This is the core processing notebook. It aggregates restaurant data by country (calculating percentages of each cuisine), handles country name mapping (e.g., England -> United Kingdom), and merges the restaurant data with the obesity data to create the final analytical dataset.

### 3. Analysis & Modeling
* **`Correlations.ipynb`**: Performs exploratory correlation analysis. It identifies which cuisines are most strongly correlated with obesity rates and visualizes these relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots.
* **`HYPOTHESIS.ipynb`**: Conducts formal statistical hypothesis testing.
    * **T-Tests:** To compare obesity rates between "High" vs "Low" fast food countries.
    * **Regression Analysis (OLS):** To determine if fast food prevalence predicts obesity while controlling for GDP per capita.

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. The "Fast Food" Effect (Risk Factor)
Our analysis revealed a **strong positive correlation ($r \approx 0.77$)** between the percentage of fast food restaurants in a country and its obesity rate.
* **Hypothesis Test:** We rejected the null hypothesis ($p = 0.013$). Countries with a "High" prevalence of fast food restaurants have a significantly higher mean obesity rate (26.9%) compared to those with a "Low" prevalence (23.8%).

### 2. The "Japanese Diet" Effect (Protective Factor)
We observed a **strong negative correlation ($r \approx -0.81$)** between the prevalence of Japanese restaurants and obesity.
* This suggests that countries with a dining landscape featuring lighter, fish-based options tend to have better public health outcomes.

### 3. Economic Context
* **GDP & Diet:** We found that wealthier countries tend to have a higher diversity of international cuisines (e.g., Thai, Asian), while lower-GDP countries rely more on regional staples (Mediterranean, Barbecue).
* **GDP & Health:** Interestingly, GDP itself was not a significant predictor of obesity in our regression model when fast food prevalence was included, suggesting that diet quality is a stronger driver than economic wealth alone.
